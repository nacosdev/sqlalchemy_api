SQLAlchemyAPI is framewoork agnostic library, and you can use it with any web framework. Currently, it provides addapters for [Starlette](https://www.starlette.io/) and [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) ([Blackship](https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheep) adapter is under development).



How to mount the [APICrud](/sqlalchemy_api/crud/introduction) instance will depend on the framework you are using, more details of each in:

- [Starlette](starlette.md)
- [FastAPI](fastapi.md)
